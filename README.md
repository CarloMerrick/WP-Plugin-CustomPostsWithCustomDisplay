# WP-Plugin-CustomPostsWithCustomDisplay
Plugin that creates a custom post in WP dashboard, also creates a display of custom posts with a shortcode. (works with custom fields plugin)

# How to use it
After adding a post through 'Webinar' custom posts & setting up relevant custom fields with the ACF Custom fields plugin,  you can add a short code to a page or post to see the output of the content. Do not that I used it on a page I created in WordPress. Feel free to modify the styling as you please. Easiest way is to just add it to a custom css plugin. ;-)
